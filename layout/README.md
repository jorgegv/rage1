# LAYOUT

This program instatiates the RAGE1 game structures and prints all fields and offsets
to ZX PRINTER so that it can be captured by a script and automatically generate
a SZXDUMP config file that dumps all interesting data from a SZX snapshot.

It is intended to be run in an emulator that emulates a ZX Printer and captures the
output sent to it (e.g. Fuse)
