# RAGE1 ChangeLog

## 0.6.0 (XXXX-XX-XX) - WORK IN PROGRESS

As we said in version 0.5.0, "Cesare The Somnambule" has been developed
using RAGE1, and as consequence version 0.6.0 has dozens of new features and
fixes which were required/uncovered by the game.  The most interesting of
these are described in the sections below.

The game is very near publication, so stay alert to its announcement!

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: the _required_ Z88DK version to compile RAGE1 is now
Z88DK 2.2 (the version must be exactly this one, not previous or later
versions).  Update your toolchain if you need to!

### New features and gameplay options

- Support for Monochrome games: you can make your btiles use a single
  default attribute, and no memory will be used for btile attributes, making
  your level definitions around 15-20% smaller (sprites still keep their
  colors, don't worry!)

- New GAME_TIME concept: a global time counter that can be checked and acted
  upon in flow rules.

- Custom user data can be stored in global Game State, and accessed from
  code functions.

- Support for multiple trackers (not only Arkos), and introducing support
  for Vortex2!

- Single Use Blobs (SUBs): these are completely self contained code, besides
  your game, that can be loaded and run before your game is run, using the
  big buffers that are used during the game, but are free at loading time. 
  They can be used for intros, music, etc.  that is executed only once just
  after the game loads, but it's discarded afterwards. They can be
  compressed, which allows for much bigger intros!

### Enhancements, Fixes and Optimizations

- Logical lines in GDATA files can now be split into multiple text lines,
  just end them with '\' character and they will be concatenated and
  processed as a single line. Very convenient for readability!

- The hero speed can now be specified in fractional pixel increments, and
  can be changed during the game. This allows gameplays where the hero speed
  depends on game factors: game time, health level, ownership of a given
  item, etc.

- Enemies can now be enabled/disabled by flow rules. This means the enemies
  can show or not depending on game conditions: game time, hero health
  level, having some specific inventory items...

- MAPGEN now generates all possible BTILE combinations, transformations, and
  subtiles, so that they do not need to be created by hand.  Also
  automatically and smartly coalesces small 1x1 BTILEs into bigger ones for
  optimizing the memory used by them.  This means you can now draw using
  your tilesets, and you can use any tile subset or transformacion (rotation
  and mirror), and MAPGEN will detect them and generate the BTILEs for you. 
  Just _draw your map_!

- The hero autofire capability can be enabled/disabled fro flow rules

- ISR configuration in 128K mode has been parameterized. Now you can specify
  the ISR vector and address and leave more low memory for bigger datasets at
  runtime!

- Banktool now calculates the optimal DATASET/CODESET layout in memory
  banks, accounting for all available free space in all banks (including the
  one used by RAGE1).  Now ALL (_all_) of the 128K memory can be used for
  games!  Everything is packed to the maximum!

- Add support for PATCH_SCREEN directive, and map and flow patching files,
  which allows adding content to an already existing SCREEN definition. 
  This makes it easy to automatically generate the screen GDATA
  configurations with MAPGEN, and patch them with items, custom btiles,
  enemies, rules, etc.

- A custom Makefile has been added to the game template: you can now add our
  own targets integrated with the regular RAGE1 ones.

- Parameters can now be passed at runtime to CALL_CUSTOM_FUNCTION checks and
  actions

- Some race conditions in critical interrupt and banking routines have been
  fixed. These were causing very rare hangs and resets.

### New tools

- New tileset mirror and rotating scripts

- New DSOPT optimizing tool for clustering screens which share the most BTILES
  and storing them in the same DATASET

- New ITEMGEN tool to quickly generate item definitions and dropoff
  mechanism rules as GDATA PATCH files.

- The old `make mem` target which reports the memory usage for the game has
  been extensively modified and now shows the exact state and usage for all
  banks and game sections

### Documentation

- WIP: The all wanted TUTORIAL is still in the works!  Sorry for moving this
  here from 0.5.0 release :-) Most probably this will come in the form of a
  series of videos (or posts) indicating the making-off process for Cesare.

## 0.5.1 (2023-03-18)

This was just a very small corrective release:

- Just some minor fixes related to Animated BTiles

## 0.5.0 (2022-12-11)

NEWS: RAGE1 is being used to develop the game "Cesare the Somnambule", by
Team Moritz! "Cesare" is a game based around the classic film "The cabinet of Dr.
Caligari", so stay tuned!

Plus, this RAGE1 version has _loads_ of new features for your adventure games!

### New Tools

- MAPGEN: a new tool that can directly use your complete game map in PNG
  format (all screens together!), and together with your BTILE files (also
  PNG) automatically generate the needed GDATA files with all the map
  definitions (tiles, items, hotzones, flow rules, etc.).

  It can even detect and generate the switching hotzones between screens, so
  that navigation of the hero around the map is fully automatic.  This means
  that you can go from drawing the map in a graphics editor to seeing your
  hero moving around in a single step!

  You can see MAPGEN example use with sample maps in
  [MAPGEN.md](doc/MAPGEN.md)!

- BTILEGEN: an auxiliary tool that creates your BTILE definitions from your
  PNG tile files and a small trivial metadata file (TILEDEF)

### New Features and Gameplay Options

- The game can now have a Loading Screen, just provide the image in .SCR or
  .PNG format and you are all done

- Support for using a custom character set in .CH8 format.  You can choose
  to replace the whole 96 chars (32-127), or just a range of them (e.g. 
  numbers and capitals) for less memory usage

- Support for adding arbitrary raw data as binary blobs: the data can be
  stored in raw form (ready to use) or ZX0-compressed, and accessed via a
  regular C byte array as needed

- Support for CRUMBS: a new type of item that can be grabbed by the hero
  multiple times (think the dots in PacMan, or the coins in Super Mario
  Bros)

- New configurable Damage Mode for the hero: you can select the "enemy
  touches you once and you die" model (Manic Miner), or the "enemy touches
  you once and you are invulnerable for a while, but the second time you're
  dead" model (Ghosts'n Globlins), or the "enemy touches you and your energy
  goes down until you die" model (Phantomas)...  your choice!

- New in-game timer and associated GAME_TIME checks for FLOW rules.  This
  allows for executing FLOW actions and make certain events happen depending
  on the elapsed time since the game was started (e.g.  Knight-Lore night
  and day).

- 128K music and sound effects are ready!  The almighty Arkos Tracker 2 has
  been integrated into RAGE1 - this allows your game to have an in-game
  soundtrack playing while the game is running, and also sound effects are
  supported!  Of course, your game needs to be compiled in 128 mode, but you
  already know that, right?

- New in-game event system: some events are generated internally by the game
  (e.g.  the hero was hit, a buller was shot, an enemy was killed...) and
  now you can configure a special FLOW rule table to react to them in an
  efficient way.  Since it is configured with normal FLOW rules, you get all
  the FLOW actions available to react to the events (play sounds, switch
  soundtracks, set screen flags, enable tiles, etc.).  As a test-drive, all
  sounds from demo games have been migrated to the new event system.  More
  info on the available events can be found in `doc/GAME-EVENTS.md`

- New HARMFUL btiles: decorations that kill you if you step over them (or
  take energy from you if using advanced Damage mode for your hero).

- New ANIMATED btiles: decorations can now also have animations, which are
  configured in the same way as sprite animations. Animated btiles go
  specially well with HARMFUL btiles, so that your player know that some
  background that moves may harm te hero!

- The hero shooting system is now optional!  You can design games where you
  don't need weapons, or where the weapon is acquired during the game.  You
  can even disable or enable it based in game conditions specified as usual
  FLOW rules.  Of course, if your game does not use weapons at all, a whole
  bunch of code is not included (thanks, conditional compilation!) and you
  have a lot more space for graphics, screens, rules, enemies, etc.

### Enhancements, Fixes and Optimizations

- The hero can now move diagonally!

- When using 128K mode, one of the non-contended memory banks has been
  reserved for engine code, so that we have additional 16K for features. 
  Some of the most heavy engine functions have been moved into the
  additional bank, leaving more low-memory free for home bank assets. This
  is transparent to the game developer.

- Add multiple test games (including `minimal`) for testing different
  features: we have reached the point where if all features are configured
  in a single test game, the game does not fit in memory :-)

- Bullets can now have different graphics depending on the direction they
  are shot.  If you shoot balls, this does not matter very much, but it
  makes a difference if you shoot knives!

- A very powerful data analyzer and deduplicator has been included with
  DATAGEN.  You, game developer, do not need any more to take care of where
  your repeated tiles are and manage them manually for efficiency.  Just
  define all your btiles and DATAGEN will compress them all and find
  repeated tiles and byte sequences so that the space used by them is
  minimized!

### Documentation

- Of course, all the previous features and tools have been thoroughly
  documented in the associated files (DATAGEN, MAPGEN, etc.)

## 0.4.0 (2021-09-01)

### New features

- Support for 48K/128K mode with just a single `ZX_TARGET` configuration
  parameter! Compiling for 128K is as easy as setting `ZX_TARGET` to 128.

  Compilation for 128K target makes full use of the spare 5 RAM banks with
  your game data and handles automatic bank switching.  Game screens and
  assets are compressed (ZX0 - Thanks Einar Saukas!  :-) ) and located in
  different datasets and paged in and out as needed during the game.

### Fixes and optimizations

- A huge rewrite was needed for supporting 128K build

- You can't optimize what you can't measure: new tools added to aid in
  spotting optimization opportunities and measuring the results of code
  refactoring

- Heavy code size optimizations: new packed tile type map which occupies 75%
  less memory than the original implementation, and several other
  refactorings that helped reduce global memory usage for the test game in
  around 15%.

- New internal framework for conditional feature compilation: only features
  that are used in your game should be compiled in the final binary.  For
  now, only flow rules, checks and actions are using this framework, but
  more features will use it in the future for still more savings.

- New tool and script for easier FUSE debugging

### Documentation

- Documented design of 48K/128K mode architecture in
  [BANKING-DESIGN.md](doc/BANKING-DESIGN.md), and updated
  [USAGE-OVERVIEW.md](doc/USAGE-OVERVIEW.md) with new instructions

- [DATAGEN](doc/DATAGEN.md) syntax updates for the new 128K mode and
  functionalities

- Updated [OPTIMIZATIONS.md](doc/OPTIMIZATIONS.md) with the new techniques
  and tips used during the heavy optimization work done in this release

- New document [FUSE-DEBUG.md](doc/FUSE-DEBUG.md) with details for better
  debugging with FUSE emulator

## 0.3.0 (2021-06-27)

### New features

- flowgen: enable setting/resetting flags for one screen from a different
  one

- tools: added new memmap.pl tool for better memory map output from game.map

- Makefile: made new-game target generate a really minimal game which you
  can start expanding right away without deleting anything


### Graphics

- hero: refactored sprite animation to single sprite with multiple sequences

- enemy: added dual animation sequence, changing when bouncing horizontally
  or vertically

### Fixes and optimizations

- game: remove game functions runtime checks, instead #defined them and
  removed game_config structure

- interrupts: optimized ISR code

- enemy: optimized animation and redrawing sequence

### Documentation

- doc: Addec RECIPES.md for commonly used game behaviours and how to do them
  with RAGE1

- doc: Added complete memory bank design, linking issues analysis and
  solution, and possible design for a paged minimal memory manager.  This is
  very important, it lays the way to games with fully working 128K RAM

## 0.2.0 (2021-04-27)

### New features

- Game scripting system: Flowgen tool, with dozens of checks and actions
  already defined, easily extensible

- Support for BeepFX sound effect definitions

- `SCREEN_DATA` Datagen directives for drawing a map screen with its tiles
  in text mode, similar to `PIXELS` directive for Tiles and Sprites (see
  `game_data/map/Screen03.gdata` for an example)

- Quickstart and WIndows installation instructions

### General

- Customizable game functions (menu, intro, game start, game loop, game end)

- Configurable screen areas (Game, Lives, Inventory, Debug)

### Graphics

- Sprites with multiple animation sequences

- Tiles can be hidden/shown dynamically

- `BACKGROUND` elements in screens, with `PROBABILITY`

- Datagen support for fully reading pixels _and_ attribute data from PNG
  files alone for sprites and tiles (added ZX-Spectrump GIMP palette for
  easier integration)

- Support for `HMIRROR` and `VMIRROR` directives in sprite defitions, so
  that you only need to draw animations once, then mirror them for different
  movement directions

### Fixes and optimizations

- Sprite drawing optimizations

- Differentiated between "enemy" code and "sprite" code (at last! :-)

## 0.1.0 (2020-12-12)

- Initial public release

- Basic game definition:
  - Datagen tool and GDATA data format
  - Tile, sprite, hero and game definition in GDATA format
  - Graphics data format defined by inline directives (`PIXELS`, `MASK`), or
  loaded from PNG files

- Basic game functionality:
  - Tile placement
  - Sprite movement
  - Collision detection
  - Shooting
  - Item grabbing
  - Global game loop and game state management

- Working but extremely simple test game
