# RAGE1: Retro Adventure Game Engine, release 1

RAGE1 is an adventure game engine for the ZX Spectrum based on the great SP1
sprite library by Alvin Albrecht.

Its initial purpose is the generation of adventure games with zenital
pespective, but it will evolve to support other types of games, e.g.
platforms, etc.

Inspiration for this engine comes from Mojon Twins' MK1 La Churrera. In fact
beeper.asm is shamelessly copied from their code. Credit goes to them :-)

The public GIT repository for this engine is https://github.com/jorgegv/rage1

Bug reports, comments, enhancements and pull requests are very welcome.

See `doc` directory for engine usage and development documentation.
Apologies for not being complete; if in doubt, navigate the source :-)

See `doc/TODO.md` for some short term enhancements which are in the works,
and feel free to suggest more by opening GitHub issues!
