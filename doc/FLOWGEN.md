# FLOWGEN

Flowgen is a utility for compiling game scripts into code that can be
included in your game. The executable is `tools/flowgen.pl`. You need Perl
for running it.

Code generated by Flowgen is intended to be run from the check_game_flags()
function which is part of the main game loop, and from several other places.

## Basic design

* All code generated by Flowgen is configured with rules based on the
  pattern WHEN-CHECK-DO
* All rules are assigned to one or more map_screens (from now on, "screens")
* Only the rules for the current screen are executed, for performance
  reasons
* Each screen has its own lists of rules that are executed at different
  moments in the game loop. Think of these lists as "hooks" for each screen
  to be called at certain times.
* For optimizing rule storage, there is a global rule table where each rule
  is defined but with no screen information. Then, each screen has
  several tables of pointers to rules to be executed at each moment. The
  different moments are identified by the WHEN clauses in the rules
* When a new "WHEN" moment is identified (that is: when we identify a new
  point in the game loop where it would be interesting to execute hooks), we
  should define a new table in the flow_rules element of the map_screen_s
  struct (see below for the places already identified).

## Rule design

All rules follow the pattern:

`[WHEN_TO_RUN] [WHAT_TO_CHECK] [ACTION_TO_EXECUTE]`

* WHEN_TO_RUN: the point where the rule is checked and action executed if
check is successful. Options: 
  - [ ] WHEN_ENTER_SCREEN
  - [ ] WHEN_EXIT_SCREEN
  - [ ] WHEN_HERO_HIT
  - [ ] WHEN_ENEMY_HIT
  - [ ] WHEN_ITEM_GRABBED
  - [ ] WHEN_GAME_LOOP

* WHAT_TO_CHECK: the condition to check. Options:
  - [ ] CHECK_FLAG_IS_SET <flag>
  - [ ] CHECK_FLAG_IS_RESET <flag>
  - [ ] CHECK_ITEM_IS_OWNED <item>
  - [ ] CHECK_LIVES <comparison> <value>
  - [ ] CHECK_ENEMIES_ALIVE <comparison> <value>

* ACTION_TO_EXECUTE:
  - [ ] DO_SET_FLAG <flag>
  - [ ] DO_RESET_FLAG <flag>
  - [ ] DO_INC_LIVES
  - [ ] DO_DEC_LIVES
  - [ ] DO_GOTO_SCREEN <index>
  - [ ] DO_BEEPFX <fxid>
