# FLOWGEN

Flowgen is a utility for compiling game scripts into code that can be
included in your game. The executable is `tools/flowgen.pl`. You need Perl
for running it.

Code generated by Flowgen is intended to be run from the check_game_flags()
function which is part of the main game loop.

Basic design principles:

* All code generated by Flowgen is configured with rules based on the
  pattern WHEN-CHECK-DO:

`[WHEN_TO_RUN] [WHAT_TO_CHECK] [ACTION_TO_EXECUTE]`

  * WHEN_TO_RUN: the point where the rule is checked and action executed if
check is successful. Options: 
  - [ ] WHEN_ENTER_SCREEN
  - [ ] WHEN_EXIT_SCREEN
  - [ ] WHEN_HERO_HIT
  - [ ] WHEN_ENEMY_HIT
  - [ ] WHEN_ITEM_GRABBED
  - [ ] WHEN_GAME_LOOP

  * WHAT_TO_CHECK: the condition to check. Options:
  - [ ] CHECK_FLAG_IS_SET <flag>
  - [ ] CHECK_FLAG_IS_RESET <flag>
  - [ ] CHECK_ITEM_IS_OWNED <item>
  - [ ] CHECK_LIVES <comparison> <value>
  - [ ] CHECK_ENEMIES_ALIVE <comparison> <value>

  * ACTION_TO_EXECUTE:
  - [ ] DO_SET_FLAG <flag>
  - [ ] DO_RESET_FLAG <flag>
  - [ ] DO_INC_LIVES
  - [ ] DO_DEC_LIVES
  - [ ] DO_GOTO_SCREEN <index>
  - [ ] DO_BEEPFX <fxid>

* All rules are assigned to one or more screens

* Every screen has its own list of rules that are executed

* Only the rules for the current screen are executed, for performance
  reasons
