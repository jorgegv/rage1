# RAGE1 Game Development Tutorial

This document is a guide to game development with the RAGE1 engine.  RAGE1
stands for Retro Adventure Game Engine, release 1: it is a development kit
for adventure games running on the ZX Spectrum family of computers (48K and
128K models).

This tutorial is based on the development of my first serious game for the
ZX Spectrum, FAMARGON, using RAGE1.  I'll be documenting the development
process for FAMARGON, and explain how to work with the engine features while
showing practical examples with the game.

_WARNING: This document is still a work in progress, so you can expect to
find broken links and sections still not written.  This warning will be
removed when the tutorial is finished._
