# RAGE1 Game Development Tutorial

This document is a guide to game development with the RAGE1 engine.  RAGE1
stands for Retro Adventure Game Engine, release 1: it is a development kit
for adventure games running on the ZX Spectrum family of computers (48K and
128K models).

This tutorial is based on the development of my first serious game for the
ZX Spectrum, FAMARGON, using RAGE1.  I'll be documenting the development
process for FAMARGON, and explain how to work with the engine features while
showing practical examples with the game.

It is assumed that you have a working copy of the RAGE1 repository, you have
configured the [Requirements](../REQUIREMENTS.md) and successfully built the
Test Game that comes included with it.  Refer to the main
[README](../../README.md) for a quick installation guide.

broken links and sections still not written.  This warning will be removed

**Special note for Windows users:** please accept my apologies in advance. 
My main development environment for RAGE1 is Linux, so this tutorial may
show a heavy bias towards the Linux way of doing things.  I will gladly
accept any comments, suggestions and pull requests for addressing
Windows-related concerns.
